## System configuration and setup

The following are the hardware and software specifications of the system on which this solution was reproduced.

### Hardware

The hardware specifications of the system are:
  - Cloud Computing Service: AWS EC2
  - Instance Type: [g4dn.4xlarge (16 vCPUs, 64 GB RAM, and 600 GB disk)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/)
  - AMI: Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04) Version 27.0 - ami-0a7789c77135a5f8a

The details on how to launch a Deep Learning AMI can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-started-dlami/). After launching, we connected to the instance using `PuTTY`. The details can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).

### Software

The Deep Learning AMI comes with pre-installed Anaconda-based Python environments and GPU software for developing deep learning models. We used the `tensorflow_p36` environment to reproduce this solution.

#### 1. Activating the `tensorflow_p36` environment

We will start by activating the `tensorflow_p36` environment.

```bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ source activate tensorflow_p36
WARNING: First activation might take some time (1+ min).
Installing TensorFlow optimized for your Amazon EC2 instance......
Env where framework will be re-installed: tensorflow_p36
Instance g4dn.4xlarge is identified as a GPU instance, removing tensorflow-serving-cpu
Installation complete.
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$
```

Next, we will check the `Python` and `pip` versions.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ python --version
Python 3.6.6 :: Anaconda, Inc.
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ pip --version
pip 19.3.1 from /home/ubuntu/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow_p36/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pip (python 3.6)
```

Next, let's also check the GPU details using the `nvidia-smi` command.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ nvidia-smi
Mon Apr 25 16:24:09 2020

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

We can see that this AWS EC2 instance has a `Tesla T4` GPU with 16 GB memory.

#### 2. Installation of Kaggle API

The [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is a python package that enables accessing competition datasets using a command-line interface. This is required for us to download the original competition dataset and the output files from third-party kernels.

We install the Kaggle API using `pip`

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ pip install kaggle
```

Let's make sure it works properly and verify the version.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ kaggle --version
Kaggle API 1.5.6
```

After the installation, we need to set up the API credentials file `kaggle.json`. The details can be found [here](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).

## Reproducing the solution

The following are the steps to reproducing this solution:
 - Download the solution and set up the input datasets
 - Data pre-processing and feature engineering
 - Model training
 - Model prediction
 - Model ensembling

We explain these steps and the required commands in detail below.

#### 1. Download the solution and input datasets

We clone the GitHub repository using the `git` command.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ pwd
/home/ubuntu
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ git clone git://github.com/buds-lab/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis.git
```

The contents of `rank-1` directory should be looking like this.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ cd ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis/solutions/rank-1
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis/solutions/rank-1$ ls -l

```

Next, we download the Kaggle competition dataset using the `kaggle` command and extract them into the `input` directory.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) $ pwd
/home/ubuntu/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis/solutions/rank-1/
(tensorflow_p36) $ mkdir input
(tensorflow_p36) $ cd input
(tensorflow_p36) $ kaggle competitions download -c ashrae-energy-prediction
(tensorflow_p36) $ unzip ashrae-energy-prediction.zip
(tensorflow_p36) $ ls -l
total 2937920
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  397104766 Apr 21 18:58 ashrae-energy-prediction.zip
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu      45527 Oct 10  2019 building_metadata.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu  447562511 Oct 10  2019 sample_submission.csv
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1462461085 Oct 10  2019 test.csv

-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    7450075 Oct 10  2019 weather_train.csv
(tensorflow_p36) $ cd ../
```

Alternatively, we can run this script `./scripts/01_get_data.sh`.

Next, we download leaked datasets from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station/output) and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station-drop-null/output) kernels and stored them into the `input` directory using the `kaggle` command.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) $ cd input
(tensorflow_p36) $ pwd
/home/ubuntu/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis/solutions/rank-2/
(tensorflow_p36) $ kaggle kernels output yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station
(tensorflow_p36) $ kaggle kernels output yamsam/ashrae-leak-data-station-drop-null
```

This creates `leak.feather` and `leak_null.feather` files into the `input` directory.

Finally, we need to add the local `ashrae` library path to `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. The `ashrae` library contains useful helper functions.

```bash
(tensorflow_p36) ubuntu@ip-172-31-29-254:~$ export PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis/solutions/rank-1
```

#### 2. Data pre-processing and feature engineering

In this step, data cleaning and feature engineering are done. We need to execute the below three scripts.

   1. `python prepare_data.py` - This script creates feather format files and pre-processed data into the `processed` directory. These files are used by the `meter_split_model`, `kfold_model`, and `cleanup_model`. This script ran for 9 minutes.

   2. `python scripts/02_preprocess_data.py` - This script creates the cleaned train and test dataset for the CatBoost and LightGBM models within the `input/preprocessed` directory. This script ran for 34 minutes.

and creates `meter_split_model.pickle` within the `models` directory. It ran for 7 minutes.

   ```bash
   (tensorflow_p36) $ pwd
   /home/ubuntu/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-3-solution-analysis/solutions/rank-1/
   (tensorflow_p36) $ cd meter_split_model
   (tensorflow_p36) $ python train.py
   (tensorflow_p36) $ cd ..
   ```

   2. `kfold_model` - This is a 3-fold LightGBM model using the entire training set. It creates `kfold_model.pickle` within the `models` directory.  This script ran for 8 minutes.

   ```bash
   (tensorflow_p36) $ cd kfold_model
   (tensorflow_p36) $ python train.py
   (tensorflow_p36) $ cd ..
   ```

   1. `cleanup_model` - This is also a LightGBM model trained on cleaned training set with different categorical features.
It creates `cleanup_model.pickle` within the `models` directory. This script ran for 4 minutes.

   ```bash
   (tensorflow_p36) $ cd cleanup_model
   (tensorflow_p36) $ python train.py
   (tensorflow_p36) $ cd ..
   ```

##### 3.1 CatBoost models

   Next, separate CatBoost models are trained on a different subset of data, split by meter, primary use, and site. A 12-fold cross-validation method was used (9 consecutive months as training and the remaining 3 months as validation sets).
